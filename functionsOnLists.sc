/*
 * data List[A] = Nil | A :: List[A]
 *
 * In the context of the org chart example, we already saw uses of the
 * Seq.map and Seq.fold/sum functions.
 *
 * - map applies a function to each item in a list
 *
 * - foldLeft successively applies a function to the partial result
 *   accumulated so far and the next list item
 *
 * - There is also foldRight, which does the same thing but starting
 *   from the back of the list. This makes a difference unless the function
 *   is commutative (which also implies that both of its arguments are of
 *   the same type).
 *   When used with lists, foldRight usually does things in the right order
 *   but is not tail-recursive, so its recursive call stack might grow very
 *   large.
 *
 *  - filter keeps only those items that satisfy the given predicate
 *    (boolean function).
